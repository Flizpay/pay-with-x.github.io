Additionally, it takes days for funds to arrive in merchants' bank accounts. Consequently, some merchants opt for cash-only transactions, even at the risk of missing out on business opportunities. At PayX, we are revolutionizing how merchants conduct business. With our low fees, straightforward onboarding process, and impeccable user experience, joining the PayX family has never been easier. Make the switch and witness businesses truly thrive with cashless payments.",
